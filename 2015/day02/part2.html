    The elves are also running low on ribbon. Ribbon is all the same width, so
    they only have to worry about the length they need to order, which they
    would again like to be exact.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ribbon required to wrap a present is the shortest distance around its
    sides, or the smallest perimeter of any one face. Each present also requires
    a bow made out of ribbon as well; the feet of ribbon required for the
    perfect bow is equal to the cubic feet of volume of the present. Don't ask
    how they tie the bow, though; they'll never tell.
  </p>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A present with dimensions <code>2x3x4</code> requires
      <code>2+2+3+3 = 10</code> feet of ribbon to wrap the present plus
      <code>2*3*4 = 24</code> feet of ribbon for the bow, for a total of
      <code>34</code> feet.
    </li>
    <li>
      A present with dimensions <code>1x1x10</code> requires
      <code>1+1+1+1 = 4</code> feet of ribbon to wrap the present plus
      <code>1*1*10 = 10</code> feet of ribbon for the bow, for a total of
      <code>14</code> feet.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>How many total <em>feet of ribbon</em> should they order?</p>
