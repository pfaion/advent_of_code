<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>It seems like there is still quite a bit of duplicate work planned. Instead, the Elves would <span title="If you like this, you'll *love* axis-aligned bounding box intersection testing.">like</span> to know the number of pairs that <em>overlap at all</em>.</p>
<p>In the above example, the first two pairs (<code>2-4,6-8</code> and <code>2-3,4-5</code>) don't overlap, while the remaining four pairs (<code>5-7,7-9</code>, <code>2-8,3-7</code>, <code>6-6,4-6</code>, and <code>2-6,4-8</code>) do overlap:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>5-7,7-9</code> overlaps in a single section, <code>7</code>.</li>
<li><code>2-8,3-7</code> overlaps all of the sections <code>3</code> through <code>7</code>.</li>
<li><code>6-6,4-6</code> overlaps in a single section, <code>6</code>.</li>
<li><code>2-6,4-8</code> overlaps in sections <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in this example, the number of overlapping assignment pairs is <code><em>4</em></code>.</p>
<p><em>In how many assignment pairs do the ranges overlap?</em></p>
