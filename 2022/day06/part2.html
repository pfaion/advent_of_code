<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Your device's communication system is correctly detecting packets, but still isn't working. It looks like it also needs to look for <em>messages</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>start-of-message marker</em> is just like a start-of-packet marker, except it consists of <em>14 distinct characters</em> rather than 4.</p>
<p>Here are the first positions of start-of-message markers for all of the above examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb</code>: first marker after character <code><em>19</em></code></li>
<li><code>bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz</code>: first marker after character <code><em>23</em></code></li>
<li><code>nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg</code>: first marker after character <code><em>23</em></code></li>
<li><code>nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg</code>: first marker after character <code><em>29</em></code></li>
<li><code>zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw</code>: first marker after character <code><em>26</em></code></li>
</ul>
<p><em>How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?</em></p>
